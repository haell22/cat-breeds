Hello! This is a Front-end Cat App made during my practice on Front-end Web Development.

The front-end of the website uses: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It also uses an API called "The Cat API". All images and breeds of cats come from this API.
It has a working search bar that can display cat breeds upon search.
